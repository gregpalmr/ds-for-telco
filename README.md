# ds-for-telco

This repo is a sample Jupyter Lab notebook with supporting data, modified from the http://github.com/gregoryg/ds-for-telco repo.

Modifications include updating the Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to use the default HDFS configuration from a DC/OS Mesos based HDFS service and to use a "data_lake" prefix in the HDFS file paths.
